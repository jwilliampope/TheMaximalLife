          <h2>My name is Jack and living Maximally saved my life</h2>

          <p><strong>I used to be lame</strong>. My life was stupid and silly and was I couldn't appreciate anything I had, and lamented over what I <em>didn't</em> have.</p>
          <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>

          <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
          <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I decided to be Fabulous</strong>. I put 100% of my ratty, lame possessions in the garbage, moved into a luxurious home, and became rich and Fabulous.</p>
          <p>It wasn't easy at all, until I <em>decided</em> it would be easy. Everything around me was in such a stupid and insipid place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>

          <h3>Now I live The Fabulous Life</h3>
          <p>Now that I'm living the Fabulous Life, things are so much better. I live Maximally, I enjoy all the abundance and blessing the world has to offer.</p>
          <p>Becoming Fabulous turned my life around, so <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living Maximally as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
